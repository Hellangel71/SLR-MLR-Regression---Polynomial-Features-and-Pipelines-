# Regression-Analysis-of-Oceanographic-Data-using-Pipelines-and-Hyperparameter-Tuning-

A primary analysis of data pertaining to oceangraphic properties is carried out.

A comparison of metrics for the developed Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression models is done.

Polynomial features are created and the process is streamlined using Pipelines.

Model is fine-tuned using GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning.
